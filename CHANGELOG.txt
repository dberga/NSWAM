-----v1 (version 1)

1.changed the structure of folders from a single folder of 191 files to a folder of the following structure:
			include/ ->include files for dependencies (color opponents, decompositions, csf, convol...)
			libs/ ->other projects (ciwam...)
			input/ ->input files (images or videos)
			output/ ->output files (smaps or perc. images)
			src/	->main model files (NCZLd ...)
			
2. added DWT and IDWT decomp. and inv.decomp for case of 'wav', it was missing
3. changed output types (image or saliency) for cases of:
	-output_from_model (case 'M' or 'M&w')
	-output_from_csf (case 'model','eCSF' or 'model&eCSF')
	-output_from_residu (case '1' or '0')

-----v2 (version 2)

1. general_NCZLd: overwrite of struct parameters (zli, display_plot, compute, wave...), copied/overwritten in get_default_parameters
2. general_NCZLd: removed temporal function variables (ex. zli, display_plot ...), now usage of struct variables (less memory usage, less code)...
3. general_NCZLd,NCZLd,NCZLd_per_channel,NCZLd_ON_OFF: nstripes parameter set on struct.image.nstripes (no usage as argument on each function)
4. general_NCZLd: erased duplicities, functionalities inside functions 
5. general_NCZLd: added dynamic case for general_NCZLd_setstimulus
6. NCZLd: removed temporal function variables (ex. zli, display_plot ...), now usage of struct variables (less memory usage, less code)...
7. NCZLd: erased duplicities, functionalities inside functions 
... for NCZLd_channel
9. default parameters: zli.fin_scale, zli.fin_scale_offset, zli.ini_scale changed to  wave.fin_scale, wave.fin_scale_offset, wave.ini_scale 
10. NCZLd_channel: erased img = double(img_in), using img_in = double(img_in)
11. NCZLd_channel: repaired variable names and values for fin_scale (equal to n_scales - offset)
12. NCZLd_channel: added functions for making means selecting specific frames (ex. tinit=6, tfinal=10)
13. NCZLd_channel: added functions for displaying/plotting matrixes on scale and orientation, per channel
14. NCZLd_channel: erased duplicated redefinition of struct.wave.fin_scale, now in NCZLd
15. executa: added saliency procedure on saliency_naila. executa executes saliency for SWAM and NCZLd

------v3 version 3

1. model_utils/tmatrix_to_matrix: functions for meanizing portions of matrix on time
2. load_store/display_functions: functions for displaying matrixes on scale, orientation...
3. load_store/store_functions: functions for storing and matrixes on scale, orientation...
4. erased whitening function (tmp-128)*0.75+128 ...
5. added functionality for using color opponents
6. fixed outputfromcsf function, it was using fin_scale as argument to put the residual, now using n_scales

------v4 version 4


1. added metrics file in libs
2. fixed error on using uniform image (ex. image that has no red or green, has zeros, so that do no process but not crash)
3. metrics with reading file lists, outputting scores, means of scores and stds for each method
4. removed libs "CiWAM", "SWAM_for_distro", these are now outside this framework

------v5 version 5

1. implemented for output as specified extension (mat, jpg, png...)
2. storing mats for each channel
3. general storing procedure for Rmodelinduction and channel_ON_OFF files
4. implemented recall and file utils (RF to img_out, img_out to smap), which allows to read mats and do reconstruction of images, then converting to smaps


------v6 version 6

1. cluster scripts done
2. added "display_plot.store_irrelevant" (it allows to store only relevant parameters, as iFactor, eCSF, residual, struct...)
